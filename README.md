# Random Forest Model
I've recently been playing around with machine learning algorithms, and this is a recent project of mine where I implemented a random forest model from scikit learn to predict housing prices from various housing features. These projects were inspired from projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

The jupyter notebook may be found by clicking on the file "Random Forest Predictor for Home Prices.ipynb" or by clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/Random_Forest_Model/blob/main/Random%20Forest%20Predictor%20for%20Home%20Prices.ipynb).

The data used for the model is found in the folder titled "home_data".
